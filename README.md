# dogs-vs-cats
Deep Convolutional Neural Network Step-by-Step to Classify Photographs of Dogs and Cats

### Problem Statement:

The training archive contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Train your algorithm on these files and predict the labels for test1.zip (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

The notebook *dog_vs_cat.ipynb* shows what various models and techniques I have explored in order to finalize a model.  
The notebook *final_dog_vs_cat.ipynb* contains the final model and the prediction results on the testing data set.

The datasets that were used for this project are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
